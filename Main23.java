// day 23 (8/11/2025) -- OK, so got the bot to work. Rn it hasn't made any trades but I think thats cause it hasn't detected any good openings. On another note, John Jay had
// orientation today and yesterday, Jenan seemed like she wanted to go with me and asked if i was going and what not, but I couldn't cause registration had closed. She then 
// didnt even try to find another day to go or anything. Idk man like she seems into me, but just doesn't really show it or try that hard I feel.

        System.out.println(i);

    }
