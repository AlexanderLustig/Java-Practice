// day 22 (8/09/2025) -- Ok, so I just finished setting up my bot that should hopefully trade stocks for me on its own. Will it work, probably not, but we can hope right.
// I got this idea from tiktok with the new GPT-5 update, so it should work right. LIke imagine it does and I start making actual money from this. Passive income and shit.

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main22 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();

        int num = random.nextInt(10) + 1; // 1..10
        int userGuess;

        System.out.println("Try to guess the random number (1-10)");
        
        while (true) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            userGuess = scanner.nextInt();

            if (userGuess == num) {
                System.out.println("GOOD JOB!!! YOU GUESSED THE CORRECT NUMBER");
                break;
            } else if (userGuess < 1 || userGuess > 10) {
                System.out.println("Out of range. Guess between 1 and 10.");
            } else if (userGuess < num) {
                System.out.println("WRONG. Hint: go HIGHER.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("WRONG. Hint: go LOWER.");
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
