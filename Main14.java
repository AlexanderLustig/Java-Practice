// day 14 (7/26/2025) -- Ok so me and Jenan just played a game for a bit. Mid game but it was fun cause it was with her. And now im thinking that I should get Xbox Ultimate
// that would allow us to play a bunch of games together that are coop. Plus I'm gonna need it anyways for Helldivers 2 so like ya.

public class Main14 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String email = "alexanderlustig77@gmail.com";
        String username = email.substring(0, email.indexOf("@"));
        String domain = email.substring(email.indexOf("@"));

        System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);
                System.out.println("Your domain is: " + domain);
    }
}
